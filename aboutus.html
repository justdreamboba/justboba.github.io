            <p><strong>TO BRIDGE CULTURES, AND CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE THINK ABOUT BOBA AND TEA</strong></p>
            <p> Just Dream Boba Tea Stop is a small family-owned business. Our mission to create high quality drinks with many different flavors to choose from. </p>
            <p> Our dream was to start our own little boba shop in the state of Colorado. So, in the comfort of our home, we started brainstorming. We created a list of drinks we wanted to make, many different drafts of the menu as well as the logo, and we even visited many different boba tea shops in order to get inspiration. With tons of hours spent on working on recipes and researching, we were able to start a home business. After many months, we recieved a lot of supports from close friends and family. With that, we decided to turn our dream into a plan and try to open our boba tea store.</p>

            style="float:left"></a>
            <p> We started with broken hearts as there was many competiton and very little open spaces for us to lease. But, we kept on trying and were finally able to obtain a space. Renovations, getting our licenses, and preparing everything for our shop to open took many months. But finally, we opened our shop.</p>
            <p> We tried many different recipies and created the perfect ones that we hope reach to others' standards. We were able to created our list of many drinks. Each and every one of them went through a trial and error with outside help to ensure our drinks are at the best quailty. Our drinks are made from the finest ingredients and use only high-quality tea leaves instead of artificial flavors to produce the best tasting tea. We test the tea leaves and ingredients to ensure our drinks’ consistency. More than just a drink, boba tea is an identity, indeed it courses through our veins. We set up a vast drink menu from tea, coffee to fresh juice to quench your thirst.</p>
            <p> We’ve come a long way through our fresh and innovative efforts to elevate the niche world of made-to-order beverages like bubble tea. It’s our dream to make bubble tea more accessible to everyone. In order to make that dream come true, we’ll stay high quality, passionate, and comfortable as we continue to challenge the face of the beverage industry. We wrote down three simple words down that forever anchored us in our business; quality, passion and comfort. And over time those words evolved into the three core values that now define our company. </p>
